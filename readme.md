# next-brew

A demo application using Next.js to display Brewdog beers using Punk API.
This was developed as an example to showcase Next.js at the [React Nantes](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/React-Nantes) meetup.

Thanks to:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for an awesome framework wrapping React
- [punkapi.com](https://punkapi.com) for listing all of the awesome Brewdog beer recipes
- [bulma.io](https://bulma.io) for an awesome css framework
- And always some many more open-source things to use!
